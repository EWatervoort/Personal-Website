                    I graduated from The University of Colorado Boulder in 2017 with a BA in Astrophysics. After that, I spent a year working on data from Cassini (a sattalite orbiting Saturn). With the intentional crash of Cassini, and the following loss of funding, I moved to working as an Opto-Electrical Engineer at Nutronics.

                    After a couple of years of working in a lab, I decided to do some soul searching on what I really wanted to do with my life and have found myself as a full time student at <a href = 'https://www.thinkful.com'>Thinkful.</a> <!--Link to Thinkful-->
